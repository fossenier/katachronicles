### Description:

Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421

Input: 145263 Output: 654321

Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

### Implementation:

I wrote: solution.c

I didn't write: test.c

I modified:

### Notes:

This is the compile command I ran:
gcc -I /opt/homebrew/Cellar/criterion/2.4.1_3/include -L /opt/homebrew/Cellar/criterion/2.4.1_3/lib -o test solution.c test.c -lcriterion
